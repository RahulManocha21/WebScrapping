### **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.8+ installed  
2. Google Chrome or Firefox browser (with driver for Selenium)  
3. Required Python libraries installed.

### **Usage**
Step 1: Configure website URLs, desired data fields, and output format.
Step 2: Run the script to fetch data from target websites.
Step 3: Share the processed data with the marketing team for competitor analysis.

### **Project Workflow**
Extract: Use Selenium or Requests to navigate websites and fetch HTML content.
Parse: Utilize BeautifulSoup to extract specific fields from the HTML structure.
Clean: Preprocess raw data (e.g., handling missing values, converting formats) using Pandas.
Export: Save the cleaned data in CSV/Excel format for easy sharing and analysis.

### **Challenges Addressed**
Dynamic Content: Handled websites with dynamic content using Selenium.
Captcha Bypass: Dealt with captchas using manual intervention or browser extensions.
Data Cleaning: Ensured data consistency across multiple websites with varying structures.
